                        <p>
                            This project allows all vehicles like cars and bikes to be connected to the internet, 
                            allowing warning sounds to be played when they are to run into each other before they crash.
                            This was the first time I worked with Javascript, HTML, and CSS. I don't think the codes were that bad
                            considering that it was the first time.

                        <h4>School Fest Management System</h4>
                        <p>
                            This project was one of the biggest projects i've ever worked on, and this was for the school fest that my highschool had.
                            The system included counting number of visits, and also a mystery solving game for all the participants.
                            I've learned a lot about web development and its security, and how to use databases like PostgreSQL.
                            This was also the first time my webapp was used by over 7000 people. (7526 to be exact)

                        <h4>Delta Programming Language</h4>
                        <p>
                            This is one of the projects that i'm currently working on, and it's a compiler that converts python code into C++.
                            This is done by tracking the datatype of each variable in the python code, and applying it to the generated C++ code.
                            It is really fun to work on this project.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Version Control System</h4>
                        <p>
                            I've worked on this project for about 3 years, since I was in middle school when I first learned about socket programming.
                            I got so interested in it and I made a version control system (though much more like file sharing).
                            This project was purely written in Python.
